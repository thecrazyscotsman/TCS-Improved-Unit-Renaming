# TCS-Improved-Unit-Renaming
Official releases hosted on Civfanatics.

## Description
Adds randomization options when renaming units.

Two buttons are added:
- Citizen
- Creative

Clicking the **Citizen** button will generate a name using a combination of a **rank** (available ranks are based on Age) and a **citizen name** (taken from your Civilization's pool).
Examples:
- Field Marshal George
- Sir Christope
- Lady Eliza
- Warlord Twelve Baby Macaws

Clicking the **Creative** button will generate a name using a random prefix and a random suffix taken from Civilization 6's unit name pools.
Examples:
- The Dirty Victory
- The Crimson Grenadiers
- The Green Horseman
- The 4th Brigade

This is not meant to be completely serious, and silly names may be generated. I will, however, try to provide some semblance of regional and/or historical accuracy for the Citizen ranks and names.
